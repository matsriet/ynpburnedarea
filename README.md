This repository contains python code and some accompanying data for a paper submitted to MDPI Remote Sensing, titled:

How much of a pixel needs to burn to be detected by satellites? A spectral modelling experiment based on ecosystem data from Yellowstone National Park, USA

By Mats Riet & Sander Veraverbeke



The following files are available:

main.py - Contains the main python code used to model burned environments of Yellowstone National Park. Requires endmember sample files to be used.

func.py - Contains functions used in the main.py code.

results_analysis.py - Code used to analyse and plot the data output by main.py.

reclass - Folder containing reclass rules used in QGIS to obtain the reclassified surface geological and habitat maps, which are also included.
